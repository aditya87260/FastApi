*Using POST method for creating a new blog

So for creating a new blog we have to send some information or data which we want to create
It is done using request body

When you need to send data from a client (let's say, a browser) to your API, you send it as a request body.

A request body is data sent by the client to your API. A response body is the data your API sends to the client.

Your API almost always has to send a response body. But clients don't necessarily need to send request bodies all the time.

To declare a request body, you use Pydantic models(BaseModel) with all their power and benefits.

To send data, you should use one of: POST (the more common), PUT, DELETE or PATCH.
